About This Project
========================================================

We look at [Credit](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Credit.csv) data from the book *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani.

About This Project
========================================================

We aim to run five different regressions on this Credit data in order to compare the predictors generated by each of these methods:

* Original least squares regression (OLS)
* Ridge regression (RR)
* Lasso regression (LR)
* Principal components regression (PCR)
* Partial least squares regression (PLSR)

Prepping the Data
========================================================

Before we can run the regressions on the data, we have to prepare it by converting factors into dummy variables and standardizing the data. R cannot run regressions using glmnet() when the data contains factors, and standardization of the data means that everything will be on the same scale: in terms of distance from its mean.


Prepping the Data

Before:

```
    Income Limit
1   14.891  3606
2  106.025  6645
3  104.593  7075
4  148.924  9504
5   55.882  4897
6   80.180  8047
7   20.996  3388
8   71.408  7114
9   15.125  3300
10  71.061  6819
```

After:

```
    Income   Limit
1  -0.8605 -0.4894
2   1.7253  0.8272
3   1.6846  1.0135
4   2.9425  2.0659
5   0.3025  0.0699
6   0.9920  1.4346
7  -0.6873 -0.5838
8   0.7431  1.0304
9  -0.8539 -0.6220
10  0.7332  0.9026
```

Prepping the Data
========================================================

Once we have the cleaned data set, we need to break it into two groups: a training group and a test group. Besides the OLS regression, each of these regression methods is applied first to a training subset of the data, and the results of that regression are used to predict the results of the test set.

Original Least Squares
========================================================

The classic regression method is the original least squares (OLS) regression.
