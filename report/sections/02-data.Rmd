#Data

The data we use in this project is the credit data and it includes variable Balance, the variable we are trying to predict, and ten predictors that we use
to predict Balance.  These predictors are Income, Limit, Rating, Cards, Age, Education, GenderFemale, StudentYes, MarriedYes, EthnicityAsian, EthnicityCaucasian.  The last two predictors were originally one predictor, but
it was expanded as a result of dummifying the values.
