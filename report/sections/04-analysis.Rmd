#Analysis

For OLS, we simply fit the lm function in R.  For the rest of the methods,
we first use 10 fold cross-validation to fit method on train set and find the best model based on minimum lambda for ridge/lasso and minimum prediction error sum of squares for pcr and plsr.  Next, we apply the best model to test set and calculate MSE.  Finally, we choose the regression method that gives us the lowest MSE.
