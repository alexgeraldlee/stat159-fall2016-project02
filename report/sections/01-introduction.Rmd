#Introduction

This project aims to predict data using differnet methods.
Methods used are ols, ridge, lasso, principal component regression,
and partial least sqaures regression.  We want to be able to 
predict variable 'Balance' from ten predictors.  Before we begin,
we will first make some necessary changes to our dataset using
data manipulation in R.
