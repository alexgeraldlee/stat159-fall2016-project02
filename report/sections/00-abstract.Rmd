#Abstract

This project functions as an introduction to ridge regression, lasso regression, principal components regression (PCR), and
partial least squares regression (PLSR), particularly in R. We use R to run each of these regressions and compare the coefficients
determined by each of these regressions to those generated by the original least squares regression.
